# ASP.NET_Core_MVC__database_connection
In this project, a connection to a database in MS Sql Server using a web application is developed. 
This web application has pages: Lots, Sellers, Buyers, as well as Home and Privacy. 
To go, for example, to the Lots page, you need to enter /Lots in the URL after localhost:{PORT}. Then you can see the list taken from the database.
On this page, you can modify the list by adding, editing, or removing an item.
You can also use LINQ to search for certain properties of an element. If you enter properties in the search that don't exist in the element, nothing will be displayed as a result.
When adding a new element, the fields have their own requirements. For example, a name has a minimum and maximum length, must begin with an uppercase letter, and contain no characters other than letters.
